# LLM-Context-Manager
An smart conversation management system that optimizes LLM inference costs through KV cache reuse and contextual branching using the novel Contextual Scaffolding Analysis (CSA) algorithm.

## This system revolutionizes LLM conversation handling by:

> Reducing inference costs by up to 50% (theoretically) through intelligent KV cache reuse.

> Managing conversation branches dynamically based on context relevance.

> Preserving conversation coherence while optimizing computational efficiency.
